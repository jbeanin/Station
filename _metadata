  "description" : "[h1]A soggy pile of Space Station 13 objects for your pleasure[/h1]\nGlorious vending machines and posters from Space Station 13, now in Starbound!\nThis mod is also available on Github: https://github.com/DrRumpPhD/Station\nMajor releases tagged there are also pushed here.\n\nThis is an expanded version of my previous mod, 'Boda Machine.' If you still have that mod installed, make sure you remove it before downloading this one! \nThe old version simply -replaces- the vending machine, this one adds several unique items and objects in addition to replacing the vending machine. \n\n[h1]Content[/h1]\nStarbound is a great game for building space stations and sci-fi stuff, but has always been sorely missing the authentic spessman content we know and love. \n\nWell ache no longer, this mod includes 10 unique posters from SS13, the classic BODA machine, as well as 5 new vending machines. All including drinks and beverages of course, your cheese-honker addiction is safely satiated. The ClothesMate vending machine sells SS13 themed clothing, such as the assistant's jumpsuit, and the YouTool machine provides useful 'tools' for all your space-needs. All items are complete with racial descriptions for maximum spess immersion!\n\nNew in the mod is 5 syndicate guns, as well as the energy sword and shield. Buy them at the autolathe!\n\n[h1]The Autolathe[/h1]\nAll these items are printed on the new 3D printer item, the autolathe. \nThe autolathe can be created at the second tier Inventor's Table for 5 titanium bars, 5 glass, 1 gold bar and 5 copper bars. \n\nThere is a lot of room for more content in this mod, and we may add more stuff in the future, so keep posted. If you find any bugs or incompatibilities, let us know!",
